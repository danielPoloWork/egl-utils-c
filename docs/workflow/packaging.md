# Packaging & Distribution

How `d4np-c` is built into a distributable artifact and published. This doc exists
because the project is distributed via a package registry (`capabilities.packaging`).

## Artifact

- **What ships:** the package produced by `CMake + Ninja` (and its contents — runtime only,
  no tests/benches).
- **Consumers import it via:** `#include "d4np_c.h"`.
- **Metadata:** name, version (from `version.h`), license `MIT`, and the
  links a registry expects (repo, docs, changelog).

## Registry

- **Where:** the package registry.
- **Auth:** publishing credentials live in CI secrets, never in the repo.

## Publish flow

Publishing is tied to the release ([`release.md`](release.md)) and is a **human-gated** step,
like the GitHub Release:

1. The release PR is merged and the annotated tag is pushed (`vX.Y.Z`).
2. CI builds the artifact on the tag and verifies it (contents, metadata, version match).
3. A human approves the publish step; CI pushes to the registry.
4. The published version is immutable — a mistake is fixed forward with a new version, never by
   overwriting.

## Versioning & provenance

- The published version **equals** the tag and the version constant (the consistency lint's
  `version-lockstep` enforces this).
- Prefer a reproducible build and attach provenance/SBOM where the ecosystem supports it.
